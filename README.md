- The executable files will be displayed.
- To run a test, simply click on the files, and you’ll be able to see the execution.

# Conclusions
- This is my first time using Cypress for API testing.
- It seemed simple to me, I would like to do more validations and use docker, but due to time factor it was not possible, besides, I realized that the executions of test in cypres is very simple so using docker is unnecesary.
- Regarding the page testing, it has many bugs, sometimes it returned response and sometimes it didn´t.
- The code is not 100% mine, I have to investigate through tutorials and chatgpt.
- I'm used to using python so the cypres way of coding was difficult for me to understand.
- Regarding the structure, I thought about separating each test case, however, seeing that it wasn't much, I left it only in 2 tests, that way I learned to segment test cases into a single execution file.
